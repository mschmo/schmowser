The early stages of a silly little browser engine.

This is a learning exercise which has started by following Matt Brubek's [Let's Build a Browser Engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html) series.

I'd like to explore some parser for future work:
* [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom)
* [combine](https://github.com/Marwes/combine)
* [cssparser](https://crates.io/crates/cssparser) obviously specifically for CSS rules
* [perseil](https://github.com/shepmaster/peresil)
